The Survey analyses the trends in all the important macroeconomic parameters such as public finance, inflation, balance of payments, trade, agriculture, growth, infrastructure, fiscal consolidation as well as financial intermediation, human development, and sustainable development and is used as a vehicle to send important messages to policymakers.\n\nThe Report identifies three major challenges facing the Indian economy in the long run: job creation for seizing the demographic dividend; increase in savings to ensure shift from consumption to investment; and to bring down inflation by reducing the fiscal and current account deficit. With job creation as the central theme, the Survey calls for reform of infrastructure, better and more effective regulation, and improvements in access to land and finance to encourage investment.', 'economic-survey.jpeg', 'economic-survey_thumbnail.jpeg', '395', '316'),

This question has inspired a volume of essays from Y. V. Reddy.\r\n\r\nNavigating through the debates between 2010 and 2012 on the continuing global financial crisis, Economic Policies and India’s Reform Agenda: New Thinking reflects the confidence of the former central banker who steered the nation’s banks to safer waters.\r\n\r\nReddy seeks a change in economic thought and policy-making. Arguing for a three-fold shift in the discipline, he calls for broadening the focus of policy-makers, improvisation in the tools employed by economists and an emphasis on empirical evidence. This ‘new thinking’, he says, will contribute to India’s accelerated development.\r\n\r\nNew Thinking addresses three concerns of economic thought for a developing economy: public policy after the crisis, the role of the financial sector in development, and the lessons learnt from world economies. Novel in approach, this volume critically examines India’s development strategies and suggests a ‘redefining’ of the role of the financial sector in accelerating development. The author’s observations on other developing economies and analyses of the diverse uncertainties enable a comprehensive understanding of the influence of global factors on the reform agenda for India.\r\n\r\nReddy’s New Thinking is built on experience that is gifted with foresight and understanding of theory. His language is fluid, his ideas objective, his prescriptions visionary. This collection will inspire debates, and encourage fresh perspectives on attaining the desired growth rate in India.  As it addresses a readership committed to developments in the Indian economy, his analyses are certain to question some popular convictions on the country’s economic thought and policies.', 'Economic Policies and India''s Reform Agenda.jpeg', 'Economic Policies and India''s Reform Agenda_thumbnail.jpeg', '550', '528'),

Why does the stress on bones make us stronger? Why should you write a resignation letter on your first day in the office? Why should we detest the lack of accountability at the heart of capitalism?

Moore, renowned for many other of the genre''s finest creations (Saga of the Swamp Thing, V for Vendetta, and recently From Hell, with Eddie Campbell) first put out Watchmen in 12 issues for DC in 1986-87. It won a comic award at the time (the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards for Best Writer/Artist combination) and has continued to garner praise since.\r\n\r\nPersepolis: The Story of a Childhood tells the story of Marjane Satrapi''s life in Tehran from the ages of six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah''s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken child of radical Marxists, and the great-grandaughter of Iran''s last emperor, Satrapi bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Amidst the tragedy, Marjane''s child''s eye view adds immediacy and humour, and her story of a childhood at once outrageous and ordinary, beset by the unthinkable and yet buffered by an extraordinary and loving family, is immensely moving. It is also very beautiful; Satrapi''s drawings have the power of the very best woodcuts. Persepolis ends on a cliffhanger in 1984, just as fourteen-year-old Marjane is leaving behind her home in Tehran, escaping fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in the West. In\r\n\r\nPersepolis 2: The Story of a Return we follow our young, intrepid heroine through the next eight years of her life: an eye-opening and sometimes lonely four years of high school in Vienna, followed by a supremely educational and heartwrenching four years back home in Iran. Just as funny and heartbreaking as its predecessor - with perhaps an even greater sense of the ridiculous inspired by life in a fundamentalist state - Persepolis 2 is also as clear-eyed and searing in its condemnation of fundamentalism and its cost to the human spirit.

(61, 7, 'The Fountainhead 1st Edition', 'Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff', 'Signet ', '''The Fountainhead'' by Ayn Rand represents the struggle of the human spirit to triumph in its fight against collectivism. Regarded as her breakthrough novel, the book that soon came to be regarded as a masterpiece was rejected by 12 publishers, before finally seeing the light of the day. Read the book to find out what made it such a huge success and why it has remained a top-of-the-mind literary effort even after all these years. \r\n\r\nWhen Ayn Rand started to write The Fountainhead, she wanted to steer clear of making any overt political statement. But as she began to spell out the story of the proudly individualistic Howard Roark, an architect who struggles to survive in a world ruled by traditions, she realized that there was no escaping the political or philosophical undertones. In spite of that, The Fountainhead still continues to be seen as a novel that describes one man''s fight against the system. \r\n\r\nThe characters in the novel are memorable. The protagonist is Howard Roark, an architect who believes that only an individual''s vision can produce genuine art. He decries committees and councils as he feels that their interference could result in mediocrity being passed off as art. The upright Roark is often quoted as the embodiment of the ideal man. Another main character in the novel is Peter Keating, Roark''s rival who is motivated more by material considerations rather than creative ones. Ayn Rand''s heroine Dominique Francon is a strong woman who. during the course of the book, learns to live life on her own terms. She gives in to her passion and emerges stronger and more creative because of it. \r\n\r\nThe novel goes on to answer the final question - will Roark survive his war against the system, or will he be forced to come to terms with it?\r\n\r\nThe Fountainhead got off to a moderate start. Reviews were mixed and initial sales were depressing. But the book picked up on the strength of word-of-mouth reviews and it has sold over 6 million copies and been translated into several languages. Two years after it was published, it entered the New York Times bestseller list.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, Ayn Rand worked on a condensed and illustrated version of the novel. It was syndicated in several newspapers. A film based on the book, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal was produced by Warner Brothers in 1949.\r\n', 'The Fountainhead.jpeg', 'The Fountainhead_thumbnail.jpeg', '399', '303'),

This concept has a proven scientific basis as well as real-life case studies to support it.\r\n\r\nDespite visible results, people have trouble believing in the transformational capacity of the subconscious mind. Many of them are all too eager to discard it as New Age mumbo-jumbo.

The author seeks to help every reader tune in to his/her mind, and successfully use its power in all areas of life.\r\n\r\nOnce the mind is trained to desire and visualize positive results, a strong, seemingly magical force is unleashed. It sets off a chain reaction- obstacles are surmounted, creative thinking is stimulated, and goals are confidently achieved. And the individual and his/her subconscious mind play the most important part in all of this. The author discusses several techniques to use the subconscious mind to increase the flow of health, wealth, power, and happiness in one’s life.\r\n\r\n', 'The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.jpeg', 'The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_thumbnail.jpeg', '195', '148'),
